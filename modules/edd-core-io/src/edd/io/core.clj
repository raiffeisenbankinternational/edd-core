(defmacro with-pipe
  "
  A macro to manage piped writing/reading across two threads.
  The idea is to write bytes into an output but not exhaust
  disk and memory, while another thread is consuming the
  connected input stream.

  - `out` is bound to a new instance of PipedOutputStream
  - `in` is bound to a new instance of PipedInputStream
  - `size` is an optional size for the in.

  The in is connected to the out meaning everything written
  to the out is available from in again. The out gets closed
  when exiting the macro. The in does not because it is used
  in another thread. You spawn a future that reads from
  the in, write anything you want to the out, and return
  the future. Example:

  (with-pipe [o i 0xFF]
    (let [fut (future
                (.readAllBytes i))]
      (doseq [x (range 0 3)]
        (.write o x))
      fut))

  Both out and in can be wrapped with Gzip in/output streams,
  writers/readers, etc.

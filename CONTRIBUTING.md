# Contributing

**Thank you for your interest in making this repository even better and more awesome. Your contributions are highly welcome.**

There are multiple ways of getting involved:

- [Report a bug](#report-a-bug)
- [Suggest a feature](#suggest-a-feature)
- [Contribute code](#contribute-code)

Below are a few guidelines we would like you to follow.
If you need help, please reach out to us: [community channels](https://github.com/zalando/skipper#community)


## Report a bug

Reporting bugs is one of the best ways to contribute. Before creating a bug report, please check that same issue is
not already reported. If there is same issue, you may add your information as a comment.

To report a new bug you should open an issue that summarizes the bug and provide version/commit-id, user OS and relevant 
versions of runtimes used that reproduces this issue.

If you want to provide a fix along with your bug report: That is great! In this case please send us a pull request as 
described in section [Contribute Code](#contribute-code).

## Suggest a feature

To request a new feature you should open an issue and summarize the desired functionality and its use case.

## Contribute code

This is a rough outline of what the workflow for code contributions
looks like:

- Check the list of open issues. Either assign an existing issue to yourself, or create a new one that you would like 
work on and discuss your ideas and use cases.
- Fork the repository on GitHub
- Create a topic branch, for example feature/foo fix/bar refactor/baz, from where you want to base your work. The base 
is usually master.
- Make commits of logical units and use `git commit --sign-off` to comply with [DCO](https://developercertificate.org/).
- Write good commit messages (see below).
- Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
- Submit a pull request to source repository
- Your pull request must receive approval from repository owner
- Repository owner reserve right to rewrite your commit message, author and commiter information

Thanks for your contributions!

### Code style

Repository may be formatted using specific code formatter. Please use make:format target if provided by repository 
before commiting new code. 

### Commit messages

Your commit messages ideally can answer two questions: what changed and why. The subject line should feature the “what” 
and the body of the commit should describe the “why”.

When creating a pull request, its comment should reference the corresponding issue id.

**Have fun and enjoy hacking!**

## Governance - final decisions

The project owner and lead makes all final decisions, if there is a
disagreement between contributors and maintainers.

## Contribution Limitations
Please note that contributions are purely voluntary and self-initiated. The owner should not initiate requests for amendments, alterations, modifications, or designs of the code.

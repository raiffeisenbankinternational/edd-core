# Event Driven Design Elements (edd-el)

Simple lib to support building Event-Sourcing applications. 


## Philosophy
<blockquote>
  It is not a framework!
</blockquote>

The main idea behind this library was not to be a framework,
but rather usefull set of function that will express our target
architecture design. 

It is designed with freedom. Library expresses desire to have 
stat pushed to the edge of the system and to help engineers
develop mathematically pure functions. But it has no limitations
on what you can dou (i.e. You can use directly DB connection at 
any time and make stuff dirty). 

## Bootstraping

# Architecture

Entire system is build around 2 main components:
1. Event store
2. Aggregate store

# Supported event store implementation
Currently, implementations supports following event store implementation: 
* PostgreSQL
* DynamoDB

# Supported aggregate store implementation
Currently, only one aggregate store is supported:
* ElasticSearch

# Architecture

```puml
@startuml;

interface "Command" as CMD
component "Service" as S1

database "EventStorage" {
  component "Postgres or DynamoDB" as EDB
}

database "AgragateStorage" {
  component ElasticSearch as ADB
}

queue "EventsQueue" as EQ 

CMD --> [S1] : 1.
S1 --> EDB :2.
EDB -> EQ : 3. (CDC, Async)
EQ -u-> S1 :4.
S1 -d-> ADB :5.

## Commands
To register commands user `edd.core/reg-cmd`

``` clojure
(:require 
  [edd.core :as edd]))

(edd/reg-cmd :some-command 
   (fn [ctx cmd]
      (implementation here))
```

## JSON Serialization and De-Serialization

Serialization is implemented using `metosin/jsonista` (Crrently using 
fork of metosin `alpha-prosoft/jsonista`). Implementation is actually 
using jackson. Special metion here is required because there is some 
customization done for serializing keyword values and uuid data type. 

All keyward **values** are prefixed with ":". If value is already 
containing ":" it will duplicate first ":". All uuid values will be
serialized prefixed with "#". 

```clojure
=> (:require  [lambda.util :as util])
=> (util/to-json {:a :b})
"{\"a\":\":b\"}"
=> (util/to-json {:a #uuid "d13d8c5c-2704-4fe1-8938-c339db9db15c"})
"{\"a\":\"#d13d8c5c-2704-4fe1-8938-c339db9db15c\"}"
=> (util/to-json {:a "#some"})
"{\"a\":\"##some\"}"
```
 
```clojure
=> (:require  [lambda.util :as util])
=> (util/to-edn "{\"a\":\":b\"}")
{:a :b}
=> (util/to-edn "{\"a\":\"#d13d8c5c-2704-4fe1-8938-c339db9db15c\"}")
{:a #uuid "d13d8c5c-2704-4fe1-8938-c339db9db15c"}
=> (util/to-edn "{\"a\":\"##some\"}")
{:a "#some"}
```

## UUID Gen
In namespce `lambda/uuid` there is helper function `gen` which can be used
got generating uuid's. 

UUID generation is tricky from testing perspective. To help with that there
is implementation of with-state mock is provided. Example of usage:

```clojure 
=> (:require [clojure.test :refer :all]
             [lambda.test.fixture.state :as state]
             [lambda.uuid :as uuid])
=> (deftest test-input
    (let [uuid1 (uuid/gen)
          uuid2 (uuid/gen)  
          uuid3 (uuid/gen)]
      (state/with-state
        (with-redefs [uuid/gen (fn []
                             (state/pop-item
                              :uuid/gen
                              [uuid3 uuid2 uuid1]))]
          (is (= uuid1
              (uuid/gen)))
          (is (= uuid2
              (uuid/gen)))
          (is (= uuid3
              (uuid/gen)))
          (is (= nil
              (uuid/gen)))))))

```

## Authentication
I hearby declare authentication quite unflexible. When using 
from-api filter then user each request is being checked for 
X-Authorization header (X-Authorization is used instead of 
standard because AWS LB and API Gateway sometimes take it over).
Header should contain signed JWT token. 

You can expect to get structure like:
```
(def ctx 
  {:user {:id "user-id"
          :email "user@email"
          :role :user-role}}
```
User role will be slected based on roles present in JWT token. Currently
only cognito is supported. If there are more than one role possible, it is
expected to receive `{:selected-role :user-role}` as part of request body. 
If this is not the case then user wil receive anonymous role:
```
(def ctx 
  {:user {:id "anonymous"
          :email "anonymous"
          :role :anonymous}}
```
